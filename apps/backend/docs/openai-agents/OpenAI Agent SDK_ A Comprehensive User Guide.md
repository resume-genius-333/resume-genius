## Core Concepts

The OpenAI Agent SDK is built around a set of core concepts that enable the creation of powerful and flexible multi-agent systems. Understanding these concepts is crucial for effectively using the SDK and building robust AI applications. This section provides a detailed overview of each core concept, explaining its purpose and how it contributes to the overall framework.

### Agents

At the heart of the SDK are **Agents**, which are essentially Large Language Models (LLMs) equipped with a set of instructions, tools, and configurations. An agent can be thought of as a specialized AI assistant designed to perform specific tasks. The SDK allows you to define agents with unique personalities, capabilities, and access to various tools, making them highly customizable for different applications.

An agent's behavior is primarily defined by its instructions, which are typically provided as a system prompt. These instructions guide the agent's responses and actions, ensuring that it adheres to its designated role. For example, you can create an agent that only responds in a specific language or follows a particular communication style.

### Handoffs

**Handoffs** are a key feature of the OpenAI Agent SDK that enables seamless collaboration between different agents. A handoff is a specialized tool call that allows one agent to delegate a task to another agent that is better suited for the job. This mechanism is essential for building complex multi-agent workflows where different agents with specialized skills need to work together to achieve a common goal.

For instance, you could have a triage agent that initially receives a user request and then hands it off to a specialized agent based on the language or content of the request. This allows for the creation of sophisticated, hierarchical agent systems that can handle a wide range of tasks with high efficiency and accuracy.

### Guardrails

**Guardrails** are configurable safety checks that provide an essential layer of control and validation for agent interactions. They allow you to enforce specific rules and constraints on both the input received by an agent and the output it generates. This is crucial for ensuring the reliability, safety, and security of your AI applications.

With guardrails, you can implement various safety measures, such as preventing agents from generating harmful or inappropriate content, validating the format of user inputs, and ensuring that agent responses comply with predefined standards. This feature is particularly important for applications that are deployed in production environments where safety and reliability are paramount.

### Sessions

**Sessions** provide a built-in mechanism for managing conversation history across multiple agent runs. The SDK automatically handles session memory, eliminating the need for developers to manually manage the conversation context between turns. This feature is essential for creating stateful, conversational agents that can remember previous interactions and maintain a coherent dialogue with users.

The SDK offers different session management options, including a default in-memory session and a persistent `SQLiteSession` that stores conversation history in a database. You can also implement your own custom session management solution by following the `Session` protocol, giving you full control over how conversation history is stored and managed.

### Tracing

**Tracing** is a powerful debugging and optimization tool that is built into the OpenAI Agent SDK. It automatically tracks and records the entire lifecycle of an agent run, providing a detailed view of all the interactions, tool calls, and LLM responses. This makes it easy to debug the behavior of your agents, identify performance bottlenecks, and optimize your workflows for better efficiency and accuracy.

The tracing feature is highly extensible and supports a wide variety of external destinations, including popular logging and monitoring platforms like Logfire, AgentOps, and Braintrust. You can also create custom spans and tracing processors to tailor the tracing output to your specific needs. This comprehensive visibility into the inner workings of your agents is invaluable for building and maintaining complex AI systems.




## Getting Started

This section provides a step-by-step guide to getting started with the OpenAI Agent SDK. We will cover the installation process, basic configuration, and a simple "Hello World" example to help you get up and running quickly. By the end of this section, you will have a working environment and a basic understanding of how to create and run your first AI agent.

### Installation

Before you can start using the OpenAI Agent SDK, you need to set up your Python environment and install the necessary packages. The SDK requires Python 3.9 or newer. You can install the SDK using either `venv` and `pip` or the `uv` package manager.

#### Using venv and pip

If you are using `venv` and `pip`, you can install the SDK by running the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install openai-agents
```

For voice support, you can install the optional `voice` group:

```bash
pip install 'openai-agents[voice]'
```

#### Using uv

If you prefer to use the `uv` package manager, you can install the SDK with the following commands:

```bash
uv init
uv add openai-agents
```

For voice support, you can add the optional `voice` group:

```bash
uv add 'openai-agents[voice]'
```

### Configuration

To use the OpenAI Agent SDK, you need to have an OpenAI API key. You can get your API key from the OpenAI platform. Once you have your API key, you need to set it as an environment variable named `OPENAI_API_KEY`. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

Make sure to replace `"your-api-key"` with your actual OpenAI API key. This environment variable is required for the SDK to authenticate with the OpenAI API and use the language models.

### Hello World Example

Now that you have installed the SDK and configured your API key, you are ready to create your first AI agent. The following "Hello World" example demonstrates how to create a simple agent that responds to a prompt with a haiku:

```python
from agents import Agent, Runner

agent = Agent(name="Assistant", instructions="You are a helpful assistant")

result = Runner.run_sync(agent, "Write a haiku about recursion in programming.")
print(result.final_output)
```

When you run this code, the agent will generate a haiku about recursion in programming and print it to the console. The output should look something like this:

```
Code within the code,
Functions calling themselves,
Infinite loop's dance.
```

This simple example illustrates the basic workflow of creating an agent, running it with a prompt, and getting the final output. In the following sections, we will explore more advanced features and use cases of the OpenAI Agent SDK.




## The Agent Loop

The agent loop is the core execution engine of the OpenAI Agent SDK. When you run an agent using `Runner.run()` or `Runner.run_sync()`, the SDK initiates a loop that continues until a final output is produced. This loop orchestrates the interaction between the LLM, the agent's tools, and the conversation history, enabling the agent to perform complex, multi-step tasks. Understanding the agent loop is essential for building sophisticated agents that can reason, plan, and execute actions effectively.

### How the Agent Loop Works

The agent loop follows a well-defined sequence of steps to process a user's request and generate a final output. Here is a breakdown of the key stages in the loop:

1.  **Call the LLM**: The loop begins by calling the LLM with the agent's instructions, the current conversation history, and any available tools. The LLM then generates a response based on this context.

2.  **Process the LLM Response**: The LLM's response can contain either a final output or a set of tool calls. The SDK processes this response to determine the next course of action.

3.  **Check for Final Output**: If the response contains a final output, the loop terminates, and the output is returned to the user. The criteria for what constitutes a final output can be configured based on the agent's `output_type`.

4.  **Handle Handoffs**: If the response includes a handoff, the SDK transfers control to the specified agent, and the loop continues with the new agent's context.

5.  **Execute Tool Calls**: If the response contains tool calls, the SDK executes the specified tools with the provided arguments. The results of the tool calls are then appended to the conversation history, and the loop returns to step 1 to continue the process.

This iterative process allows the agent to perform a series of actions, gather information, and reason about the best course of action until it can produce a final output that satisfies the user's request. You can also use the `max_turns` parameter to limit the number of iterations in the loop, preventing infinite loops and ensuring that the agent's execution is bounded.

### Final Output Logic

The agent loop's termination is determined by the final output logic. The SDK provides two main ways to define what constitutes a final output:

*   **With `output_type`**: If you specify an `output_type` for your agent, the loop will continue until the LLM generates a structured output that matches the specified type. This is useful for tasks that require a specific output format, such as a JSON object or a Pydantic model.

*   **Without `output_type`**: If you do not specify an `output_type`, the first LLM response that does not contain any tool calls or handoffs is considered the final output. This is suitable for simpler tasks where the agent's response is a plain text message.

By understanding and leveraging the agent loop, you can build powerful and intelligent agents that can handle a wide range of complex tasks with ease.




## Advanced Features

The OpenAI Agent SDK offers a range of advanced features that enable you to build highly sophisticated and capable AI agents. These features provide greater control over agent behavior, facilitate complex multi-agent workflows, and enhance the overall development experience. This section delves into some of the key advanced features of the SDK, including handoffs, tools, sessions, and tracing, with detailed explanations and practical examples.

### Handoffs: Enabling Multi-Agent Collaboration

Handoffs are a powerful mechanism for enabling collaboration between different agents in a multi-agent system. They allow one agent to delegate a task to another agent that is better suited for the job, facilitating the creation of complex, hierarchical workflows. This is particularly useful for applications that require a combination of specialized skills to handle a user's request.

#### How Handoffs Work

A handoff is essentially a specialized tool call that transfers control from one agent to another. When an agent invokes a handoff, the SDK pauses the current agent's execution and activates the designated agent. The new agent then takes over the conversation, inheriting the context and conversation history from the previous agent. This seamless transition allows for a smooth and efficient workflow, where different agents can contribute their expertise to solve a problem.

#### Handoffs Example

The following example demonstrates how to use handoffs to create a triage agent that delegates requests to either a Spanish-speaking agent or an English-speaking agent based on the language of the user's input:

```python
from agents import Agent, Runner
import asyncio

spanish_agent = Agent(
    name="Spanish agent",
    instructions="You only speak Spanish.",
)

english_agent = Agent(
    name="English agent",
    instructions="You only speak English",
)

triage_agent = Agent(
    name="Triage agent",
    instructions="Handoff to the appropriate agent based on the language of the request.",
    handoffs=[spanish_agent, english_agent],
)


async def main():
    result = await Runner.run(triage_agent, input="Hola, ¿cómo estás?")
    print(result.final_output)
    # ¡Hola! Estoy bien, gracias por preguntar. ¿Y tú, cómo estás?


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

In this example, the `triage_agent` is configured with two handoffs: `spanish_agent` and `english_agent`. When the `triage_agent` receives a request in Spanish, it hands off the conversation to the `spanish_agent`, which then responds in Spanish. This simple yet powerful mechanism allows you to build sophisticated, multi-lingual agent systems with ease.




### Tools: Extending Agent Capabilities

Tools are a fundamental component of the OpenAI Agent SDK, allowing you to extend the capabilities of your agents beyond simple text-based responses. With tools, you can connect your agents to external APIs, databases, and other resources, enabling them to perform a wide range of actions, such as retrieving information, performing calculations, and interacting with other systems. This section explains how to create and use tools with your agents.

#### Creating Tools

The SDK provides a simple and intuitive way to create tools using the `@function_tool` decorator. This decorator allows you to turn any Python function into a tool that can be used by your agents. The function's signature, including the function name, arguments, and type hints, is automatically used to generate a tool definition that the LLM can understand and use.

#### Tools Example

The following example demonstrates how to create a simple tool that retrieves the weather for a given city and use it with an agent:

```python
import asyncio

from agents import Agent, Runner, function_tool


@function_tool
def get_weather(city: str) -> str:
    """Gets the weather for a given city."""
    return f"The weather in {city} is sunny."


agent = Agent(
    name="Hello world",
    instructions="You are a helpful agent.",
    tools=[get_weather],
)


async def main():
    result = await Runner.run(agent, input="What's the weather in Tokyo?")
    print(result.final_output)
    # The weather in Tokyo is sunny.


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

In this example, the `get_weather` function is decorated with `@function_tool`, turning it into a tool that the agent can use. The agent is then configured with this tool, and when it receives a request about the weather, it automatically calls the `get_weather` tool with the appropriate arguments and returns the result to the user. This powerful feature allows you to create highly capable agents that can interact with the real world and perform a wide range of tasks.




### Sessions: Managing Conversation History

Sessions are a crucial feature for building stateful, conversational agents that can remember previous interactions and maintain a coherent dialogue with users. The OpenAI Agent SDK provides built-in session management that automatically handles conversation history, eliminating the need for developers to manually manage the context between turns. This section explains how to use sessions to create more engaging and intelligent agents.

#### How Sessions Work

The SDK's session management is designed to be both simple and flexible. When you use a session with an agent, the SDK automatically stores the conversation history, including user inputs, agent responses, and tool calls, in a persistent or in-memory store. This history is then provided to the agent in subsequent turns, allowing it to maintain context and respond appropriately.

#### Sessions Example

The following example demonstrates how to use the `SQLiteSession` to create a persistent session that stores conversation history in a SQLite database:

```python
from agents import Agent, Runner, SQLiteSession

# Create agent
agent = Agent(
    name="Assistant",
    instructions="Reply very concisely.",
)

# Create a session instance
session = SQLiteSession("conversation_123")

# First turn
result = await Runner.run(
    agent,
    "What city is the Golden Gate Bridge in?",
    session=session
)
print(result.final_output)  # "San Francisco"

# Second turn - agent automatically remembers previous context
result = await Runner.run(
    agent,
    "What state is it in?",
    session=session
)
print(result.final_output)  # "California"
```

In this example, the `SQLiteSession` is used to maintain the conversation history for the session ID `"conversation_123"`. In the second turn, the agent automatically remembers the context from the first turn and correctly answers that the Golden Gate Bridge is in California. This powerful feature allows you to build sophisticated conversational agents that can handle multi-turn dialogues with ease.

### Tracing: Debugging and Optimizing Agent Behavior

Tracing is an indispensable tool for debugging and optimizing the behavior of your agents. The OpenAI Agent SDK provides built-in tracing that automatically records the entire lifecycle of an agent run, giving you a detailed view of all the interactions, tool calls, and LLM responses. This visibility is crucial for understanding how your agents work, identifying issues, and improving their performance.

#### How Tracing Works

The SDK's tracing feature is designed to be both comprehensive and extensible. It automatically captures a wide range of information about each agent run, including the agent's instructions, the user's input, the LLM's responses, and the results of any tool calls. This information is then organized into a structured trace that you can view and analyze.

The tracing feature is also highly extensible, allowing you to create custom spans and integrate with a variety of external tracing processors, such as Logfire, AgentOps, and Braintrust. This flexibility allows you to tailor the tracing output to your specific needs and integrate it with your existing monitoring and debugging workflows.

By leveraging the power of tracing, you can gain deep insights into the behavior of your agents, identify and resolve issues quickly, and optimize your workflows for better performance and reliability.




## Best Practices

Building robust, efficient, and reliable AI agents requires more than just understanding the core concepts and features of the OpenAI Agent SDK. It also involves following a set of best practices that have been established through experience and community feedback. This section provides practical tips and recommendations to help you build high-quality agents that are both powerful and easy to maintain.

### Agent Design

*   **Keep Agents Focused**: Design your agents to be specialized and focused on a specific set of tasks. Avoid creating monolithic agents that try to do everything. Instead, break down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable sub-tasks and create specialized agents for each one. This will make your agents more efficient, easier to debug, and more reusable.

*   **Use Clear and Concise Instructions**: The instructions you provide to your agents are crucial for guiding their behavior. Use clear, concise, and unambiguous language to define the agent's role, capabilities, and constraints. This will help the LLM understand its task and generate more accurate and relevant responses.

*   **Leverage Handoffs for Complex Workflows**: For complex tasks that require multiple specialized skills, use handoffs to create a multi-agent workflow. This will allow you to combine the strengths of different agents and create a more powerful and flexible system. Design your triage agent to be intelligent and efficient in delegating tasks to the appropriate specialized agents.

### Tool Usage

*   **Create Well-Defined Tools**: When creating tools for your agents, make sure they are well-defined and have clear and descriptive names, arguments, and docstrings. This will help the LLM understand how to use the tools correctly and generate more accurate tool calls.

*   **Handle Tool Errors Gracefully**: Your tools should be designed to handle errors gracefully and provide informative error messages. This will help you debug issues with your tools and prevent them from crashing your agents. Use try-except blocks to catch exceptions and return meaningful error messages to the agent.

*   **Secure Your Tools**: If your tools interact with sensitive data or systems, make sure to implement appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access or malicious use. Use authentication, authorization, and input validation to protect your tools and the systems they interact with.

### Session Management

*   **Choose the Right Session Type**: The OpenAI Agent SDK provides different session management options, including in-memory and SQLite-based sessions. Choose the session type that best suits your application's needs. For simple, single-turn interactions, an in-memory session may be sufficient. For multi-turn conversations that need to be persisted, a SQLite-based session is a better choice.

*   **Use Unique Session IDs**: When using sessions, make sure to use unique session IDs for each conversation. This will prevent conversations from getting mixed up and ensure that each user has their own private conversation history.

*   **Manage Session Data**: Be mindful of the amount of data you store in your sessions. Large conversation histories can consume a significant amount of memory and slow down your agents. Implement a strategy for managing session data, such as truncating old messages or summarizing the conversation history, to keep your sessions lean and efficient.
